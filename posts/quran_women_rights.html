    <h1>Comparison of Women’s Rights</h1>
    <h2>Qur’an vs. Vedas & Smriti Texts</h2>

    <div class="description">
        <p>The Qur’an contains passages that prescribe different rights and roles for men and women. Some of these differences have been interpreted as granting women fewer rights, particularly in family, inheritance, and legal matters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-examples">
        <h3>Key Examples in the Qur’an</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inheritance</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Qur’an 4:11 says that a son receives a share equal to that of two daughters.</li>
                    <li>Justification given: men are seen as financially responsible for family maintenance (Qur’an 4:34).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Testimony</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Qur’an 2:282 states that in financial contracts, two female witnesses equal one male witness.</li>
                    <li>Reasoning: to prevent mistakes if one woman forgets, the other can remind her.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Marriage and Divorce</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Men are described as having a degree of authority over women (Qur’an 4:34).</li>
                    <li>Men can divorce more easily (through ṭalāq), while women’s divorce rights are more restricted (khulʿ requires conditions or judicial approval).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Polygamy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Qur’an 4:3 permits men to marry up to four wives (if they can treat them equally), but women are limited to one husband.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="quran-vs-vedas">
        <h3>Quran vs Vedas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Qur’an’s Context (7th century Arabia)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arabia was patriarchal and tribal.</li>
                    <li>Women had very limited rights: no inheritance, no property ownership, no guaranteed dowry, could be inherited themselves.</li>
                    <li>The Qur’an gave women rights that were an improvement for that time:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right to inherit (even if less than men).</li>
                            <li>Right to keep mahr (dowry) as their own property.</li>
                            <li>Right to consent in marriage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>However, verses (e.g., 4:11, 4:34, 2:282) still placed men above women—reflecting the patriarchal society in which Islam emerged.</li>
                    <li>So, many scholars argue the Qur’an represents a partial reform within its society, not full equality.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vedas’ Context (2nd millennium BCE India)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda) are much older (c. 1500–500 BCE).</li>
                    <li>They do not codify a legal system like Qur’an or Torah. Instead, they contain hymns, rituals, and philosophical ideas.</li>
                    <li>Women (e.g., Ghosha, Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi) appear as philosophers and poets in Vedic texts.</li>
                    <li>No explicit injunctions saying women inherit less or that two women equal one man in testimony.</li>
                    <li>Later texts (like Dharmashastras, Manusmriti, c. 200 BCE onward) introduced restrictions: subordinating women to father/husband/son, limiting property rights, discouraging women from studying Vedas.</li>
                    <li>So, the inequality came later, not directly from the Vedas themselves.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Qur’an:</strong> codified improved but unequal rights within a patriarchal 7th-century society.</li>
            <li><strong>Vedas:</strong> contained no explicit gender inequality laws, but later Hindu lawbooks introduced them.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="hindu-law-texts">
        <h3>Later Hindu Law Texts</h3>
        <p>Here are a few well-known passages where later Hindu law texts (Dharmashastras, especially Manusmriti) impose restrictions on women, which are not found in the Vedas themselves.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Subordination to Father/Husband/Son</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Manusmriti 5.148:</em> “In childhood a woman must be subject to her father, in youth to her husband, and when her husband is dead, to her sons; she must never be independent.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Limiting Property Rights</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Manusmriti 9.416:</em> “A woman is not entitled to the sacrificial fee, nor to independence in the house, nor to property. What she earns belongs to the man under whose protection she lives.”</li>
                    <li>In contrast, Vedic women (like Gargi, Maitreyi) engaged in philosophical debates without such restrictions mentioned.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Discouraging Study of the Vedas</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Manusmriti 9.18:</em> “A woman must not perform sacrifices, study the Veda, or fast without her husband; if a woman obeys her husband she will attain heaven.”</li>
                    <li>Yet in the Rigveda, women like Lopamudra and Ghosha composed hymns, showing women did study and recite Vedas earlier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Marriage and Control</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Manusmriti 8.365:</em> “If a wife, proud of her family or beauty, deceives her husband, the king should have her devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many.”</li>
                    <li>This reflects harsh patriarchal enforcement absent in Vedic hymns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Contrast with Vedas</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rigveda 10.85 (Marriage hymn):</strong> portrays the bride as an honored figure, welcomed into her husband’s family with blessings.</li>
            <li><strong>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.6, 4.5:</strong> Gargi and Maitreyi are respected female philosophers engaging in debate with Yajnavalkya.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s not only Manusmriti. Several other Dharmashastras and Smriti texts also contain rules restricting women’s rights. Manusmriti is just the most cited.</p>
        <h4>Key Pattern</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Earlier texts (Vedas, early Dharmasutras):</strong> women have some rights and are active in rituals and learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Later texts (Manusmriti, Yajnavalkya, Narada, Parashara):</strong> codified patriarchal norms, restricting inheritance, study, remarriage, and autonomy.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here’s a side-by-side comparison of women’s rights in later Hindu Smriti texts vs. Qur’an to highlight similarities and differences:</p>

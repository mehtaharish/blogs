            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The core Vedas (Śruti), including the Ṛgveda, Sāmaveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and their associated
                Saṁhitās, Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas, and Upaniṣads, present a largely gender-neutral worldview. In these texts, girls
                and boys are equally celebrated in spiritual, educational, and ritual contexts. Women seers like
                Lopāmudrā, Gārgī, and Maitreyī composed hymns, engaged in philosophical debates, and were recognized for
                their wisdom, showing that freedom of speech, education, and participation in rituals were open to both
                genders. Similarly, rites related to birth, marriage, property, cremation, and ancestral offerings in
                the Vedas either include daughters explicitly or do not differentiate by gender.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast, Post-Vedic texts (Smṛtis and Purāṇas) such as Manusmṛti, Yājñavalkya Smṛti, and the Purāṇas
                introduced social and ritual hierarchies that favored boys over girls. Sons became the primary heirs of
                property, the main performers of śrāddha and cremation rituals, and the preferred carriers of lineage.
                Girls, while still valued, were often restricted to secondary roles, their rights limited mainly to
                strī-dhan (dowry or personal gifts), and their participation in public rituals and education curtailed.
                Even in marriage, daughters’ choices were increasingly controlled by guardians, while sons retained
                greater freedom. Practices like Sati, glorified in later Purāṇas, further demonstrate the patriarchal
                tilt in post-Vedic society.
            </p>
            <p>
                In essence, while the Vedas uphold equality and inclusion, later texts progressively institutionalized
                gender-based restrictions, highlighting a significant shift in the treatment and social roles of boys
                and girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us explore this topic in greater detail by examining various aspects individually.

            <h2>📜 Definition of Vedic and Post-Vedic Texts</h2>
            <p>
                The Vedic texts (Śruti) are the oldest and most sacred Hindu scriptures, believed to be divinely
                revealed. They include the four Vedas — Ṛgveda, Sāmaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda — along with their
                Saṁhitās, Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas, and Upaniṣads. These texts focus on hymns, rituals, philosophy, and guidance for
                sacrifices, promoting spiritual knowledge, ethical living, and societal harmony, generally without
                gender bias. Post-Vedic texts (Smṛti and Purāṇas), on the other hand, are human-authored works that
                interpret and apply Vedic teachings. They include law codes (like Manusmṛti), epics (Mahābhārata,
                Rāmāyaṇa), and Purāṇas (Vishnu, Padma, Garuḍa, etc.), offering guidance on law, social norms, rituals,
                and mythology. These later texts are more context-specific and often show a patriarchal tilt, especially
                in matters like inheritance, ritual duties, and gender roles.

            <h2>Girls’ Birth</h2>

            <h3>🌿 Core Vedas (Śruti)</h3>
            <p>
                In the Vedas, prayers for sons (putra) are more common, but this does not mean that daughters (putrī)
                were considered a curse. Some key points:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Atharvaveda 6.11.3:</strong> “A heroic son may be born to us.”<br>
                    👉 Here, the prayer is for a son because sons were considered responsible for continuing śrāddha
                    (ancestor rituals) and the lineage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rigveda 10.85.46 (Vivāha Sūkta):</strong><br>
                    “May you be the mother of heroic sons, and may your daughter-in-law bring prosperity into your
                    home.”<br>
                    👉 Here, the role of daughters is described as auspicious and compared to wealth and prosperity
                    (Lakṣmī).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rigveda 10.159 (Apālā hymn):</strong><br>
                    The female seer (ṛṣikā) Apālā expresses her life and experiences — this shows that the birth of
                    women was given due respect in the Vedic worldview.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                🔑 <strong>Summary of Vedic attitude:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preference for sons was due to ritualistic reasons.</li>
                <li>However, the birth of daughters was never considered inauspicious or unfortunate.</li>
                <li>In the Vedas, women were regarded as Vāk-devī (goddess of speech) and Gṛha-lakṣmī (goddess of the
                    household).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>📜 Purāṇas and Later Smṛti Texts</h3>
            <p>
                By the time of the Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstras (c. 200 BCE – 1200 CE), the preference for sons became even
                stronger.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Manusmṛti 9.135–138:</strong> Sons were made mandatory for repaying the debt to ancestors
                    (pitr̥-ṛṇa).<br>
                    👉 This is why daughters were referred to as “parāya dhan” (someone else’s wealth, to be given away
                    in marriage).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Garuda Purāṇa (Pretakalpa):</strong> Funeral and śrāddha rites were almost always performed
                    by sons.<br>
                    👉 The role of daughters was excluded here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vishnu Purāṇa & Padma Purāṇa:</strong> Daughters were considered divine (devī-svarūp), but
                    they were also seen as gifts to be given away in marriage (kanyādāna = the greatest gift).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bhāgavata Purāṇa:</strong> In several instances, daughters were portrayed as embodiments of
                    devotion (e.g., stories of Devahūti, Kunti, and Draupadī).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                🔑 <strong>Summary of Purāṇic attitude:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The birth of girls was referred to as “Gṛha-lakṣmī” (goddess of the household).</li>
                <li>However, rituals (like śrāddha and lineage continuity) became strictly son-centric.</li>
                <li>In Purāṇic stories, daughters were glorified as divine figures, but in social practice, they were
                    seen as “parāya dhan” (someone else’s wealth), while sons were considered the primary heirs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>⚖️ Contrast</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Core Vedas (Śruti):</strong> Daughters were considered auspicious, not cursed; sons were
                    preferred for ritual duties, but women had spiritual authority and even composed hymns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purāṇas/Smṛti:</strong> Daughters were seen as Lakṣmī (goddess of wealth), but socially
                    “given away”; sons were made ritually indispensable, creating a stronger preference for boys.

            <h2>Education & Women’s Role</h2>

            <h3>🌿 In Core Vedas (Śruti)</h3>
            <p>
                The Vedas themselves do not explicitly restrict education by gender. Instead, they show examples of
                women actively learning, teaching, and even composing hymns.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Women Ṛṣikās (female seers):</strong><br>
                    Around 27 women seers are credited with composing Vedic hymns (e.g., Lopāmudrā, Ghoṣā, Apālā,
                    Maitreyī, Gargī). Their hymns are preserved in the Ṛgveda.<br>
                    → This shows that women could be authors of revelation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Debates & philosophy:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gārgī Vācaknavī in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad debates Yājñavalkya on metaphysics.</li>
                        <li>Maitreyī, wife of Yājñavalkya, is taught ātma-vidyā (knowledge of the Self).</li>
                    </ul>
                    These stories prove women were considered fit for the highest knowledge (Brahmavidyā).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sanskāras (rites of passage):</strong><br>
                    Girls could undergo upanayana (sacred thread initiation) in early Vedic times. Such girls were
                    called Brahmavādinī (lifelong student of Veda) or Sadyovadhū (who studied until marriage).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                🔑 <strong>Conclusion from Śruti:</strong><br>
                The Vedas see women as capable of Vedic study, debate, and spiritual realization, with examples of women
                sages, philosophers, and teachers.
            </p>

            <h3>📜 In Purāṇas & Later Dharma Texts</h3>
            <p>
                By the time of Purāṇas (and also Dharmaśāstras like Manusmṛti), the view of women’s role shifts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Restricted Vedic education:</strong><br>
                    Later texts often say Vedas should not be taught to women. Manu, for example, suggests women should
                    be instructed in dharma through fathers/husbands, not through direct Vedic study.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Role centered on domesticity:</strong><br>
                    Women are praised primarily as wives and mothers. Their religious merit is linked to serving the
                    husband, raising children, and devotion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purāṇic stories:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many Purāṇas glorify sati-like devotion (e.g., Sāvitrī reviving Satyavān).</li>
                        <li>Women are celebrated more as symbols of śakti (divine energy), but not usually encouraged in
                            independent scholarship.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                🔑 <strong>Conclusion from Purāṇas:</strong><br>
                The Purāṇic worldview tends to limit women’s direct participation in Vedic study, framing their role
                more in terms of household duty and devotion rather than open intellectual debate.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Śruti (Vedas/Upaniṣads):</strong> Women = sages, students, philosophers. Education open.

                <li><strong>Purāṇas/Dharma texts:</strong> Women = wives, mothers, devotees. Education restricted, roles

                    Daughters were excluded, and their sons (putrikā-putra) were occasionally allowed as substitutes.
                    This discrimination of “boys > girls” developed outside the Śruti, in the Smṛti/Purāṇic era.</li>

                <li><strong>Recognition of daughters in the Rigveda:</strong> Daughters were regarded with wealth,

                <li>
                    <strong>Ṛgveda 10.85.46:</strong> “May this bride be the queen of her household, ruling over the
                    property, cattle, and home.”<br>
                    👉 Here, the daughter is referred to as the Lakṣmī (goddess of wealth) of the household, and she is
                    given rights over property.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Atharvaveda 14.1.20:</strong> The bride is considered the owner of prosperity and property
                    in the household.
                </li>
                <li>There are no direct inheritance rules (explicit laws) in the Vedas. Wealth rights in the Vedas were
                    not restricted based on gender; however, later Dharmasūtras and Smṛti texts introduced specific
                    rules.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Daughter’s position:</strong> Some hymns describe daughters as contributors to prosperity,
                    wealth, and family growth. There is no clear discrimination between boys and girls in this context.

                    “A son alone can save the ancestors from hell (putra-narakāt trāyate iti putraḥ).”<br>
                    — This led to the inheritance system becoming patrilineal.

                <li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Purāṇas (Garuda Purāṇa, Vishnu Purāṇa, etc.):</strong> Symbolically, daughters were given
                    wealth and strī-dhan (jewels, gifts, dowry), but sons were preferred for primary property
                    inheritance.

                <li>
                    <strong>Strī-dhan Concept:</strong> In Smṛti and Purāṇas, daughters were given full rights over
                    strī-dhan (jewels, ornaments, gifts at marriage, maternal gifts). This was considered their personal
                    property, which neither the husband nor the in-laws could claim.
                </li>

            <h3>⚖️ Contrast</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vedas (Śruti):</strong> There was no explicit gender bias in wealth rights. Brides/daughters

                        <li><strong>Atharvaveda 7.38.4–6:</strong> The bride had the right to choose her groom according

                <li>

                    <ul>

                            without the consent and choice of the bride.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ṛgveda 10.85 (Vivāh Sūkta):</strong> Both the groom and bride are described as

                    </ul>

                    still young, to a suitable man.” → Here, the bride’s choice was reduced, and control by guardians

                <li>

                    </ul>
                    Gandharva marriage (mutual choice) was acknowledged in the scriptures, but later it was discouraged

                <li>

                    (pitr̥-dharma), where it became their responsibility to arrange the daughter’s marriage. Boys were
                    given more freedom to choose their spouse.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>➡️ Thus, in the Purāṇas and Smṛti, marriage rights became gendered:</p>

                            <li>There is a mantra here that is often misunderstood:</li>
                            <li>“Uttishṭhā nāry abhijīva…” → Meaning: “O woman (widow), rise, separate yourself from
                                your husband’s body, and return to the world. Resume your household duties.”</li>
                            <li>It is clear here that the wife is advised to live and start a new life, not to burn
                                herself on the pyre.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>🔹 Atharvaveda (18.3.1):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This also contains a funeral mantra that mentions the widow returning to life.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>➡️ Meaning: In the Śruti (Core Vedas), there is no command for Sati. Instead, widows are encouraged
                    to start a new life.</p>

                <h3>2. Gṛhya Sūtras & Dharmaśāstras (Smṛti)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Baudhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra:</strong> Mentions an early tradition where the widow sits beside
                        the pyre, but it is symbolic and does not involve death.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Manusmṛti:</strong> Does not mandate Sati. However, it imposes very restrictive rules on
                        widows, requiring them to live a life of austerity and discouraging remarriage.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Purāṇas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Padma Purāṇa, Skanda Purāṇa, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa (medieval interpolations):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sati is glorified as the “highest duty of a devoted wife.”</li>
                            <li>If a widow enters the pyre with her husband, she is promised heavenly rewards.</li>
                            <li>This glorification led to the evolution of the social practice, which became rigid in
                                medieval India.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>➡️ Thus, Purāṇic narratives glorified Sati as the ultimate duty of a devoted wife, which became
                    institutionalized in society.</p>

                <h3>4. Boy vs Girl Perspective</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Boy (widower, on the death of his wife):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No ritual similar to Sati was ever created for him.</li>
                            <li>Widowers were not prohibited from remarrying; in fact, remarriage was encouraged
                                (especially in Manusmṛti).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Girl (widow):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the Vedas: Widows are encouraged to live and start a new life.</li>
                            <li>In Smṛti/Purāṇas: Remarriage was discouraged, and Sati was glorified, creating an
                                asymmetric burden on women.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>⚖️ Contrast</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Vedas (Śruti):</strong> There is no sanction for Sati. Widows are advised to “rise
                        and return to life.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Later Smṛti & Purāṇas:</strong> Social restrictions were imposed on widows (Manusmṛti).
                        Purāṇic narratives idealized Sati. Widowers (men) were given freedom, while widows (women) were
                        bound by restrictions.</li>
                </ul>

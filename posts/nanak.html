            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469–1539) was the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. He is
                remembered not just as a spiritual leader but as a social reformer who challenged blind rituals, caste
                discrimination, and inequality. His teachings emphasize devotion to one God, honest living, selfless
                service, and equality of all human beings. Notably, his core teachings are aligned with the spiritual
                principles of the Vedas — such as truth, righteousness, and devotion — but he opposed the later
                mechanical or superstitious rituals that had developed in Puranas and other traditions. He was a
                visionary who challenged societal norms, promoted equality, and emphasized devotion over ritual. His
                life is a reminder that spirituality is lived through action, compassion, and love for all beings, and
                that the essence of Vedic wisdom lies in inner devotion, not in mechanical or superstitious rituals.</p>

            <p>Guru Nanak strongly opposed ritual practices that were mechanical, superstitious, or discriminatory:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Caste-based restrictions:</strong> He rejected untouchability and emphasized equality of
                    all.</li>
                <li><strong>Fasting, pilgrimages, and self-mortification:</strong> True devotion, he said, comes from
                    honest living and service, not bodily punishment.</li>
                <li><strong>Idol worship (Moorti Puja):</strong> God is formless; worship should come from the heart.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Animal sacrifices:</strong> Compassion and devotion are superior to killing animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual purity laws for women (including menstruation):</strong> Women are equal in spiritual
                    capacity and must not be excluded from religious life.</li>
                <li><strong>Funeral rituals:</strong> Death is natural; remembrance of God and righteous living matters
                    more than elaborate ceremonies.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> External rituals are meaningless without truth, devotion, and ethical
                action. These ideas reflect the original spiritual wisdom of the Vedas, while he rejected the later
                rigid, ritualistic practices that had become common in society.</p>

                        of one God.”</strong></li>
                <li>He then embarked on long journeys across India, Tibet, Arabia, and Persia to spread his message of

            </div>

            <p>Guru Nanak’s core teachings include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ik Onkar:</strong> Belief in one God.</li>
                <li><strong>Naam Japna:</strong> Remember God through meditation and prayer.</li>
                <li><strong>Kirat Karni:</strong> Honest living and hard work.</li>
                <li><strong>Vand Chakna:</strong> Sharing with others and selfless service (seva).</li>
                <li><strong>Equality:</strong> All humans are equal, regardless of caste, gender, or religion.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji teaches that true purity is not in outer rituals but in the inner state of one’s mind
                and heart. A life of meaning begins with <em>daya</em> (compassion), <em>santokh</em> (contentment), and
                <em>sat</em> (truthfulness). The real test of spirituality is not how we appear, but how we act —
                whether our thoughts, words, and deeds bring peace or pain to others. The Gurus remind us that ignorance
                lies in judging others, while wisdom lies in self-reflection and humility. We are called to live
                consciously — seeing the same Divine Light in all beings, and serving creation with love, honesty, and
                gratitude. When our actions arise from compassion instead of ego, the entire world becomes sacred, and
                every moment becomes a prayer.

            <h2>Stories</h2>
            <h3>1. The Mecca Feet Story and Modern Rituals</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/Nanak Mecca.jpg" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>
            <p>During his spiritual travels, Guru Nanak Dev Ji visited Mecca, the holiest city in Islam. While resting
                there, he naturally lay down with his feet pointing toward the Kaaba, which, according to local custom,
                was considered disrespectful. The caretakers asked him to turn his feet away. Guru Nanak replied:</p>
            <blockquote>“Show me a direction where God is not.”</blockquote>
            <p>As the story goes, when they tried to move his feet, the Kaaba itself moved to align with his feet,
                symbolizing that God is omnipresent.</p>
            <p><strong>The spiritual lesson:</strong> True devotion is not about outward postures, strict rules, or
                mechanical rituals. God is everywhere, and sincere remembrance of the Divine from the heart is what
                truly matters.</p>
            <h4>Modern Rituals vs. Guru Nanak’s Teachings</h4>
            <p>Many gurdwaras today enforce rules like not showing one’s back to the Guru Granth Sahib, or restrictions
                on attire. While intended to maintain respect, these rigid practices often:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prioritize form over essence:</strong> They focus more on appearances, gestures, and
                    clothing than on humility, devotion, and ethical living.</li>
                <li><strong>Can exclude sincere devotees:</strong> Children, visitors, or those unaware of the rules may
                    feel unwelcome, even though their heart is in the right place.</li>
                <li><strong>Contradict Guru Nanak’s core teaching:</strong> Guru Nanak repeatedly emphasized that God
                    sees the heart, not posture, dress, or ritual compliance.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Many modern rules, when applied rigidly, do not align with Guru Nanak’s
                message of universal, inclusive, and heart-centered devotion. True spirituality lies in love, humility,
                compassion, and remembrance of God, not in mechanical adherence to outward forms.</p>

            <h3>2. 🌾 Sacha Sauda — The True Bargain and Its Forgotten Spirit</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/nank sacha sauda.jpg" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <p>When Guru Nanak Dev Ji was a young man, his father gave him twenty rupees to do business — hoping to
                teach him how to earn profit. On his way to the market, Guru Nanak met a group of hungry saints who had
                not eaten for days. Seeing their suffering, he decided that the most valuable business was to serve
                those in need.</p>
            <p>He used all the money to buy food and fed the saints with love and humility. When his father asked what
                he had done, Nanak replied,</p>
            <blockquote>“I have made the Sacha Sauda — the True Bargain — by serving humanity.”</blockquote>
            <p>This simple act became a timeless lesson that service, compassion, and equality are the highest forms of
                devotion. True profit is not measured in coins, but in kindness.</p>

            <h4>🕊️ The Contrast in Modern Times</h4>
            <p>Today, the spirit of Sacha Sauda continues through the Langar — a sacred tradition where everyone, rich
                or poor, sits together and eats the same food. The langar was meant to erase boundaries of caste,
                wealth, and pride. It embodies Guru Nanak’s vision of equality:</p>
            <blockquote>“No one is high or low; all are children of the same Creator.”</blockquote>
            <p>Yet, in practice, this spirit is not always upheld. At some gurdwaras — even the most revered ones — poor
                or homeless visitors are sometimes turned away from entering the main premises or from the langar area.
                They may be stopped because of their appearance, their clothing, or because they come frequently for
                food or shelter.</p>
            <p>When this happens, the place that was built to welcome all — the house of the Guru — becomes selective,
                guided by human judgment rather than divine compassion.</p>

            <h4>🌼 The Deeper Message</h4>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji opposed all forms of ritualism, discrimination, and spiritual pride.<br>He taught that
                God resides in every being, not in wealth or social position.<br>His teachings remind us that feeding
                the hungry, helping the poor, and embracing the forgotten are not acts of charity — they are acts of
                worship.</p>
            <p>If a poor person is turned away from a gurdwara, it is not that person who is impure — it is the
                institution that has forgotten the essence of its own founder’s message.</p>
            <p>The Sacha Sauda teaches us that the true trade is one of love, humility, and service.<br>Whenever we
                close our doors to those in need, we lose that true bargain — the bargain that Guru Nanak once made with
                twenty rupees, but which carried infinite spiritual wealth.</p>

            <h3>3. 🌟 The Story of Gagan Mein Thaal, Chand Deepak</h3>

            </div>


            <p>The aarti <a href="gagan_mein_thaal.html" class="aarti">"Gagan Mein Thaal, Chand Deepak"</a> is a
                composition of Guru Nanak Dev Ji that presents a cosmic
                vision of worship. It’s a poetic and spiritual way of showing that true devotion does not need idols,
                lamps, or ritual objects.</p>
            <h4>Key Lines & Meaning:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>“The sky is my plate, the sun and moon are my lamps; the stars are pearls.”</strong><br>
                    Guru Nanak emphasized that the entire universe is God’s temple, and everything in it — sun, moon,
                    stars, clouds, wind, flowers — can be part of divine worship.</li>
                <li><strong>“Fragrance of sandalwood is incense; the wind is the fan; the trees and flowers are
                        offerings.”</strong><br>
                    He replaced ritual items with elements of nature, teaching that God is worshipped through
                    recognition of His presence everywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>“The Unstruck Sound (Anhad Shabad) is the vibration of true devotion.”</strong><br>
                    Worship is meditation, service, and inner connection, not lighting lamps or following ceremonies
                    blindly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Guru Nanak’s Message at that Time:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>God is formless (Nirankar) and omnipresent.</li>
                <li>Human-made idols or images are unnecessary.</li>
                <li>True aarti (worship) comes from humility, selfless service (seva), and remembrance of God.</li>
                <li>He rejected rituals that give the illusion of devotion without inner sincerity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>🔍 What We Do Now in Some Gurdwaras</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Many gurdwaras hang photos of the Sikh Gurus as a way of teaching history and showing reverence —
                    that in itself is fine if used for inspiration and remembrance.</li>
                <li>However, in several gurdwaras today, photos of Bhindranwale or other contemporary figures are also
                    displayed alongside Guru images.</li>
                <li>Sometimes rituals like bowing or garlanding are done toward these photos.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>⚖️ Why This Contradicts Guru Nanak’s Teachings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Idol-like veneration:</strong> Guru Nanak specifically rejected ritualistic worship of human
                    forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus shifts from God to humans:</strong> Devotion should remain on God, service, and moral
                    principles, not on any human, however heroic.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential for division:</strong> Elevating specific human figures can introduce political or
                    communal biases, contrary to Nanak’s message of equality and universality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>🌿 In Essence</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Guru Nanak’s “Gagan Mein Thaal” reminds us:</li>
                <li>“Look at the universe — sun, moon, stars, and all life — as your temple. Serve, meditate, and
                    remember God. Do not get lost in images or rituals.”</li>
                <li>Modern practices of hanging human photos, performing rituals toward them is the opposite of this
                    teaching. While the intention may be respect or remembrance, it risks turning devotion toward humans
                    rather than the Formless Divine, which Guru Nanak explicitly warned against.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. 🦏 The Rhino Sacrifice Story</h3>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/Nanak Rhino .png" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>


            <p>In the Janamsakhi tradition, there's an account where Guru Nanak Dev Ji visited a place where Brahmins
                were preparing to sacrifice a rhinoceros as part of a religious ritual. Upon witnessing this, Guru Nanak
                questioned the logic of such sacrifices, pointing out the contradiction in claiming that eating meat is
                sinful while simultaneously engaging in ritualistic animal killings. He emphasized that true
                spirituality lies in devotion to the One God, not in performing sacrificial rites.</p>
            <p>This story illustrates Guru Nanak's opposition to blind rituals and his advocacy for a direct, personal
                connection with the Divine. He taught that spiritual purity is not achieved through external ceremonies
                but through inner devotion and ethical living.</p>

            <p>There is a <a href="nanak_maas.html" class="aarti">shabad</a> which reinforces exactly what he
                demonstrated in that story — rejecting ritual
                killings, debates, and outward shows of purity, and instead emphasizing inner awareness and ethical
                living.</p>




            <h3>5. Story of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the Janeu (Sacred Thread)</h3>


            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/Nanak  Janeu.jpeg" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <p>When Guru Nanak Dev Ji was a young boy in Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib, Pakistan), the village elders
                wanted him to follow the traditional Hindu rituals. One of these was the Janeu ceremony (also called
                “Upanayana”), where young boys are given a sacred thread to mark the beginning of their spiritual and
                religious education.</p>
            <p>Guru Nanak’s family and the priest asked him to wear the Janeu. According to the story:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Young Nanak looked at the Janeu and refused politely.</li>
                <li>He said that wearing a thread around the body cannot make a person pure or holy. True purity comes
                    from compassion, truth, self-discipline, and devotion to God—these are the real sacred threads.</li>
                <li>He explained that rituals and external symbols are meaningless if the heart and mind are not
                    virtuous.</li>
                <li>This early display of wisdom astonished the elders. Even as a child, Nanak emphasized inner
                    spirituality over external formalities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This incident is reflected in a <a href="janeu.html" class="aarti">shabad</a> (Ang 471), where Guru Nanak
                explains that the real Janeu is made
                of virtues—not cotton or wool worn externally.</p>


            <h3>6. 🌿 The Story: Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the Cup of Wine</h3>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/guru nanak wine.png" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>


            <p>During one of Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s journeys (Udasis), he visited a royal court where wine flowed
                freely. The local ruler, curious about the saint’s detachment, offered him a cup of alcohol and said:
            </p>
            <blockquote>“Holy man, everyone drinks this to be happy. It removes worries — come, have a sip!”
            </blockquote>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji smiled gently and said:</p>
            <blockquote>“If it truly brings peace, then why does the drinker lose wisdom, speak harshly, and forget
                truth?You call it joy, but it’s a joy that fades — leaving sorrow and shame behind.”</blockquote>
            <p>He then sang a Shabad explaining what true intoxication is.</p>

            <h4>🌍 Today’s World Connection</h4>
            <p>In today’s society, alcohol has become:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A social ticket — “you’re boring if you don’t drink.”</li>
                <li>A symbol of success — champagne with promotions, parties, and fame.</li>
                <li>A mask — to escape anxiety, loneliness, or pressure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But look deeply —this is exactly what Guru Nanak Dev Ji warned us about 500 years ago.</p>
            <blockquote>“The body forgets its Master and sits in pride.”— Ang 554</blockquote>
            <p>Alcohol makes us feel powerful for a moment, but inside it distances us from truth, clarity, and
                compassion.When ego, anger, or guilt follow a night of “fun,” the false happiness reveals itself.</p>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s words remain timeless:</p>
            <blockquote>“Do not drink this false wine. The true intoxication is Naam — the joy of awareness, peace, and
                love.”</blockquote>

            </div>

            <p>During one of his travels, Guru Nanak Dev Ji visited a town where people considered a local river’s water
                to be holy. They told him:</p>
            <blockquote>“O Guru, this water cleanses sins. Drink it and you will be pure!”</blockquote>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji smiled and asked:</p>
            <blockquote>“If water alone could purify, why do people fight, lie, and steal after drinking it? True
                cleansing comes not from the cup, but from the heart.”</blockquote>
            <p>He then offered the water to the villagers and said:</p>
            <blockquote>“Drink if you wish, but remember: compassion, truth, humility, and devotion are the waters that
                truly purify the soul.”</blockquote>
            <p>The villagers realized that drinking water alone cannot cleanse their mind or actions; purification comes
                from living righteously and meditating on Naam.</p>

            <h4>📜 Shabads Related to Holy Water</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1️⃣ Ang 68, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Raag Asa</strong><br>
                    “ਨਾਨਕ ਜਲੁ ਪੀਵੈ ਸਭਿ ਦੁਖੁ ਤਿਆਗੇ ॥”<br>
                    “One may drink water, yet without God’s Name, all sorrows remain.”</li>
                <li><strong>2️⃣ Ang 343, Guru Nanak Dev Ji</strong><br>
                    “ਸਬਦੁ ਜਲੁ ਸੰਤੋਖੁ ਜੀਵਨੁ ਹੈ ॥”<br>
                    “The Word of the Guru is the water that gives life; contentment is its essence.”</li>
                <li><strong>3️⃣ Ang 475, Guru Nanak Dev Ji</strong><br>
                    “ਪਾਣੀ ਪੀਤੈ ਬਹੁ ਬਿਪਤਾ ਨਾਹਿ ਗਉਣਿ ਪਾਏ ਪਾਵਨੁ ॥”<br>
                    “Many drink water, yet troubles remain; only through the Lord’s Name does one find cleansing.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🌱 Connection to the Modern World: Sarovar Water</h4>
            <p>Today, many devotees drink water from the Harimandir Sahib Sarovar, even though:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The water may not be hygienic.</li>
                <li>People think it will cure everything without reflecting on their actions.</li>
                <li>Their mind is not clean, but they assume drinking water will wash sins away.</li>
                <li>They may return home and continue bad deeds, believing the ritual alone will purify them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s lesson is timeless:</p>
            <p><strong>Faith + action > ritual alone</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical water is symbolic; it reminds the mind to be humble and pure.</li>
                <li>True cleansing happens through Naam Simran, good deeds, and moral living — not from blindly
                    consuming water.</li>
                <li>Just as drinking the Sarovar water without mindfulness doesn’t purify, mere rituals or habits (like
                    mindless drinking or performing acts without understanding) cannot cleanse the soul.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. 🚪 The Four Doors of the Gurudwara</h3>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/gurudwara four doors.jpg" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>

            <p>When Guru Arjan Dev Ji (the 5th Guru) started building the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar around 1588, he
                gave specific, revolutionary instructions to the architect:</p>
            <blockquote>“Make four entrances — one on each side — North, South, East, and West.”</blockquote>
            <p>This was shocking at that time because in most religious places (especially temples and mosques of that
                era), there was only one door, and only certain castes, religions, or classes could enter.</p>

            <h4>⚖️ Symbolism of the Four Doors</h4>
            <p>Guru Arjan Dev Ji said:</p>
            <blockquote>“The Guru’s house is open to all —people of every caste, colour, creed, or country.Whosoever
                wishes to remember God may enter.”</blockquote>
            <p>Thus, the four doors symbolized:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>North →</strong> the people of knowledge and intellect (scholars, teachers).</li>
                <li><strong>South →</strong> the people of labour and physical work.</li>
                <li><strong>East →</strong> the people of devotion and discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>West →</strong> the people of courage and worldly engagement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It was a poetic way of saying:“All directions lead to the One — Ik Onkaar.”</p>

            <h4>🌿 2️⃣ Story: The Rejected King</h4>
            <p>One story says that when Harmandir Sahib was completed, a nearby Mughal ruler came and asked Guru Arjan
                Dev Ji:</p>
            <blockquote>“Will you bless me to enter from the royal door?”</blockquote>
            <p>Guru Ji replied gently:</p>
            <blockquote>“There is no royal door here. Every door is equal, every man is equal.The only crown in this
                place is humility.”</blockquote>
            <p>That is why even today, the entrance is below ground level — one must step down into the temple,
                symbolizing humility before the Divine.</p>

            <h4>📖 3️⃣ Shabad Connection</h4>
            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji says (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 953):</p>
            <blockquote>“Aval Allah Noor Upaya, Kudrat Ke Sab Banday;Ek Noor Te Sab Jag Upjeya, Kaun Bhale Ko
                Mande.”<br>
                First, the Light of the Divine was created, from which all beings came;So how can one be good and
                another bad?</blockquote>
            <p>This is the very spirit of those four doors — the equality of all humanity.</p>


            <h3>9. 📜 Desecration of Guru Granth Sahib</h3>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/guru-granth-sahib.jpg" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>


            <p>Once, during Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s time, there was a learned scholar, Pandit Durgadatta, who was very proud
                of his knowledge.He kept his scriptures covered with silk and would not let anyone touch them — saying,
                “Only the pure may touch these holy books!”</p>
            <p>Guru Nanak Ji went to meet him.He asked the Pandit,</p>
            <blockquote>“Pandit Ji, what is more sacred — the letters on the paper or the Word (Shabad) that lives in
                the heart?”</blockquote>
            <p>The Pandit replied proudly,</p>
            <blockquote>“Of course, these holy books are pure. Touching them with unclean hands is sin.”</blockquote>
            <p>Guru Nanak smiled and said,</p>
            <blockquote>“If the hand is dirty, you can wash it with water. But if the mind is dirty with pride, anger,
                or ego — what will you wash it with?”</blockquote>
            <p>He continued,</p>
            <blockquote>“The true scripture is the Word that cleans the heart, not the paper that feeds the ego.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>That day the Pandit bowed down and understood:The real impurity is not in touching — it is in forgetting
                God and humanity.</p>

            <h4>📖 Related Shabad – Guru Nanak Dev Ji (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 472)</h4>
            <p><strong>ਮੈਲੁ ਗਇਆ ਤਨੁ ਸਾਚੈ ਧੋਇਆ ॥ ਮਨੁ ਨਿਰਮਲੁ ਹੋਆ ਸਚੁ ਸੋਇਆ ॥</strong><br>
                <em>Mail gaya tan saachai dhoya, man nirmal hoaa sach soya.</em><br>
                “The filth (impurity) is washed away when the body is cleansed with Truth;The mind becomes pure when it
                rests in the True One.”
            </p>
            <p>This means: outward cleanliness or ritual protection of holy objects means nothing if the inner mind is
                filled with anger, pride, or cruelty.</p>

            <h4>⚖️ Now, connect this to the modern incident:</h4>
            <p>An unfortunate incident (it has happened more than once in recent years) where a person who appeared
                mentally ill or confused entered a Gurudwara or the Harmandir Sahib complex and touched or mishandled
                the Guru Granth Sahib Ji — sometimes with his feet or hands — and was beaten or even killed by members
                of the Sangat.</p>
            <p>Today, in some Gurdwaras, people act as if the physical Guru Granth Sahib Ji needs their violent
                protection.But Guru Sahib Himself is eternal — the Shabad, not the paper.If someone (especially a
                mentally unwell person) touches the Pothi Sahib with their foot, it is not the Shabad being insulted —
                it is our ego being tested.</p>
            <p>What truly dishonours Guru Nanak’s path is not the accidental touch, but the killing of a helpless human
                being.The same Guru who fed lepers, hugged outcasts, and embraced the “impure” — would He have wanted
                the Sangat to kill?</p>
            <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>

            <h3>10. 🏠 The Dharamsal</h3>


            <p>Let’s explore clearly what was the purpose of the Gurudwara (Sangat place) in Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s time,
                and how it was completely different from today’s ritualized concept.</p>

            <h4>🕊️ 1️⃣ Background: Before Guru Nanak’s Time</h4>
            <p>Before Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469–1539 CE), the subcontinent’s religious landscape was dominated by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temples, mosques, and mutts with priests or mullahs controlling access to God.</li>
                <li>Strong divisions of caste, gender, and wealth.</li>
                <li>Heavy focus on rituals, offerings, and pilgrimages, often without inner reflection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Guru Nanak’s mission was to free people from the monopoly of intermediaries and reconnect humanity
                directly to the Divine through truthful living (Sachiar).</p>

            <h4>🏠 2️⃣ What Guru Nanak Created Instead — The Dharamsal</h4>
            <p>During Guru Nanak’s lifetime, there were no “Gurudwaras” as buildings like we have today.He established
                “Dharamsals” — places of Sangat (holy gathering) and Simran (remembrance of Naam).</p>

            <h4>🪶 Purpose of the Dharamsal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To gather all — regardless of caste, gender, or faith.</strong><br>
                    ◦ Everyone sat together equally (Langar began here).<br>
                    ◦ Equality and humility were lived, not preached.</li>
                <li><strong>To meditate on the Naam.</strong><br>
                    ◦ People sang Shabads — Guru Nanak’s hymns — with kirtan and understanding, not mechanical chanting.
                </li>
                <li><strong>To learn and discuss truth (Giaan).</strong><br>
                    ◦ These were open learning spaces — Guru Nanak encouraged questions and discussions, not blind
                    following.</li>
                <li><strong>To serve others (Seva).</strong><br>
                    ◦ Each Dharamsal had Langar (free kitchen). Everyone, including the Guru, worked together — showing
                    that serving others is serving God.</li>
                <li><strong>To live the message, not just hear it.</strong><br>
                    ◦ Guru Nanak said:“Ghaal khaye kichh hathahu de — Nanak rahu pachhane se.”<br>
                    ◦ “Earn by honest work, share with others — only then one truly lives by the Guru’s way.”<br>
                    ◦ The Dharamsal was a living example of this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🌸 3️⃣ Spiritual Meaning of the Early Gurudwara (Dharamsal)</h4>
            <p>It was not a place for ritual or idol worship.It was a school of truth, a community center, a kitchen of
                equality, and a temple of Naam — all in one.</p>
            <p>Guru Nanak used it to create:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A living Sangat (holy community)</li>
                <li>A spirit of learning and serving</li>
                <li>A shared spiritual space for all humanity</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🌍 4️⃣ The Modern Connection</h4>
            <p>Today, many people go to Gurudwaras for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ritual offerings (matha tekna, karah prasad, langar),</li>
                <li>Occasional visits for festivals or to “fulfill wishes,”</li>
                <li>Without deeper reflection or community connection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But the true spirit of the Gurudwara, as envisioned by Guru Nanak, was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Living spirituality in daily life, not visiting occasionally.</li>
                <li>Sangat as family, not crowd.</li>
                <li>Service as worship, not donations as transaction.</li>
                <li>Naam Simran as cleansing, not superstition or show.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, if Guru Nanak Dev Ji were to walk into a modern city today, he would probably ask:</p>
            <blockquote>“You have made my Dharamsal beautiful, but are your hearts open?Do you sit together without
                judgment?Do you feed the hungry, serve the needy, and speak truth with courage?”</blockquote>
            <p>That’s the true test of a Gurudwara.</p>

            <h3>11. 🌺 Taboos about Menstruation</h3>


            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="images/menstruation.png" alt="Timeline" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>


            <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji clearly opposed all superstitions and discriminatory customs, including the
                restrictions placed on women during menstruation.</p>

            <h4>🕊️ 1️⃣ The Context in Society Then</h4>
            <p>In Guru Nanak’s time (15th–16th century Punjab), society — both Hindu and Muslim — held deeply rooted
                taboos about menstruation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Women were seen as “impure” during their monthly cycle.</li>
                <li>They were excluded from kitchens, temples, and prayers.</li>
                <li>Many were forbidden from touching food or water, even from sleeping on normal beds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Guru Nanak openly challenged these ideas as part of his wider mission to remove hypocrisy and
                superstition from spirituality.</p>

            <h4>📜 2️⃣ Guru Nanak’s Teachings in Gurbani</h4>
            <p><strong>🔹 Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji – Ang 472</strong></p>
            <p><strong>ਭੰਡਿ ਜੰਮੀਐ ਭੰਡਿ ਨਿੰਮੀਐ ਭੰਡਿ ਮੰਗਣੁ ਵੀਆਹੁ ॥ਭੰਡਹੁ ਹੋਵੈ ਦੋਸਤੀ ਭੰਡਹੁ ਚਲੈ ਰਾਹੁ ॥ਭੰਡੁ ਮੁਆ ਭੰਡੁ ਭਾਲੀਐ
                    ਭੰਡਿ ਹੋਵੈ ਬੰਧਾਨੁ ॥ਸੋ ਕਿਉ ਮੰਦਾ ਆਖੀਐ ਜਿਤੁ ਜੰਮਹਿ ਰਾਜਾਨ ॥ਭੰਡਹੁ ਹੀ ਭੰਡੁ ਊਪਜੈ ਭੰਡੈ ਬਾਝੁ ਨ ਕੋਇ ॥ਨਾਨਕ ਭੰਡੈ
                    ਬਾਹਰਾ ਏਕੋ ਸਚਾ ਸੋਇ ॥</strong><br>
                “From woman, man is born; within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married.With woman
                are friendships formed; with woman the lineage continues.When the woman dies, another is sought; through
                woman, man is bound to the world.So why call her bad, from whom even kings are born?From woman, woman is
                born; without woman, there would be none at all.O Nanak, only the True Lord is without woman.”</p>

            <h4>💡 Meaning and Message</h4>
            <p>This Shabad is Guru Nanak’s direct challenge to the patriarchal and superstitious mindset that treated
                women as inferior or impure.He is saying:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Woman is divine and essential to life itself.</li>
                <li>Without her, no man — not even kings or prophets — would exist.</li>
                <li>Therefore, how can anyone call her “impure”?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That includes the natural process of menstruation — which is simply part of divine creation, not
                something dirty.</p>

            <h4>🌼 3️⃣ Guru Nanak’s Broader View</h4>
            <p>Guru Nanak repeatedly rejected ritual purity and impurity based on physical things — whether food, caste,
                or body.</p>
            <p>He said impurity comes only from bad thoughts and actions, not from the body:</p>
            <p><strong>🔹 Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji – Ang 472 (same section)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>ਜੇ ਰਤੁ ਲਗੈ ਕਪੜੈ ਜਾਮਾ ਹੋਇ ਪਲੀਤੁ ॥ਜੋ ਰਤੁ ਪੀਤੈ ਮਾਣਸਾ ਤਿਸੁ ਕਿਉ ਨ ਪਲੀਤੁ ॥</strong><br>
                “If a cloth becomes impure by blood, then the one who drinks blood (i.e., commits violence or sin) — why
                is he not impure?”</p>
            <p>This is a direct question to the hypocrites — those who declare a woman impure due to natural blood, but
                themselves harm others and think they are pure.</p>

            <h4>🌍 4️⃣ Connection to Today’s World</h4>
            <p>Even today, Bhaiya, many still:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat women as “unclean” during menstruation.</li>
                <li>Stop them from entering kitchens or gurdwaras.</li>
                <li>See it as something shameful.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s message was crystal clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Menstruation is divine, not defiled.</li>
                <li>The impurity lies only in the mind, not in nature.</li>
                <li>Spirituality is about inner cleanliness, not outer restriction.</li>
            </ul>

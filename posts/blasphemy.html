    <h1>Blasphemy in Religious Traditions</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Blasphemy</h2>
        <p>Blasphemy means showing disrespect, contempt, or irreverence toward something considered sacred ‚Äî usually God, gods, religious beliefs, holy figures, or scriptures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Qur‚Äôan Point of View</h2>
        <h3>1. No worldly punishment prescribed</h3>
        <p>The Qur‚Äôan does not prescribe a legal punishment (like death or imprisonment) for blasphemy. Instead, it emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patience</li>
            <li>Turning away from mockers</li>
            <li>Leaving judgment to God</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Qur‚Äôan 6:68 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen you hear God‚Äôs revelations being denied and ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in a different conversation‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
            <li>Qur‚Äôan 4:140 ‚Äì repeats the same guidance: if people mock faith, believers should avoid their company.</li>
            <li>Qur‚Äôan 73:10 ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.‚Äù</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Judgment is left to God</h3>
        <p>The Qur‚Äôan stresses that God Himself will deal with blasphemers, either in this world or the next:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Qur‚Äôan 3:186 ‚Äì believers will hear ‚Äúmuch abuse‚Äù from others, but are asked to show patience and fear God.</li>
            <li>Qur‚Äôan 45:9 ‚Äì those who mock God‚Äôs revelations are promised punishment from God.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs example</h3>
        <p>The Qur‚Äôan shows the Prophet was mocked and called names (poet, madman, liar), but he was commanded to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay patient (15:95‚Äì96).</li>
            <li>Trust God for protection, not seek revenge.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="summary">
            <h3>üìå Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Qur‚Äôan itself does not call for execution or worldly punishment for blasphemy.</li>
                <li>The guidance is: avoid, ignore, be patient, and let God judge.</li>
                <li>Harsh punishments (like death) for blasphemy come later from Hadiths and Islamic legal traditions, not directly from the Qur‚Äôan.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Blasphemy Come Later from Hadiths and Islamic Legal Traditions</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Hadiths about blasphemy</h3>
        <p>Unlike the Qur‚Äôan (which stresses patience and leaving judgment to God), some Hadiths describe cases where people who insulted the Prophet were punished with death.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ka‚Äòb ibn al-Ashraf</strong> (a poet in Medina) ‚Äì reportedly killed for mocking the Prophet and stirring hostility.</li>
            <li><strong>Asma bint Marwan</strong> ‚Äì said to have been killed for verses criticizing the Prophet (though this narration is debated for authenticity).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These narrations became the basis for later jurists to treat insulting the Prophet as a capital offense.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Classical Islamic Law (Fiqh)</h3>
        <p>Islamic jurists (sharia scholars) developed blasphemy laws drawing from Hadiths and analogy (qiyas).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hanafi school:</strong> Blasphemy by Muslims = apostasy ‚Üí punishable by death (unless repented). Non-Muslims insulting the Prophet were also punishable.</li>
            <li><strong>Maliki, Shafi‚Äòi, Hanbali schools:</strong> Generally agreed insulting God, the Prophet, or sacred things = capital crime, with no chance of pardon in some views.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>3. Difference from Qur‚Äôan</h3>
        <p>So:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Qur‚Äôan:</strong> Avoid mockers, be patient, leave judgment to God.</li>
            <li><strong>Hadith & Fiqh:</strong> Introduced worldly punishments, including death, especially for insulting the Prophet.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>4. Modern Muslim-majority countries</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia:</strong> Have strict blasphemy laws with death penalty (based on Hadith + later Fiqh).</li>
            <li><strong>Turkey, Indonesia, Egypt:</strong> Laws exist but with prison/fines rather than death.</li>
            <li><strong>Many Muslim reformist thinkers today:</strong> Argue punishment should be left to God, following the Qur‚Äôan‚Äôs approach, not legal enforcement.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h3>‚ú® In short:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Qur‚Äôan itself never prescribes execution for blasphemy.</li>
                <li>The Hadith tradition and later jurists introduced it, and that‚Äôs what shaped the laws in many Muslim societies today.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Blasphemy in Hindu Tradition</h2>
        <p>Hinduism is pluralistic, with no single scripture or authority prescribing punishments for speech against gods or scriptures. Let‚Äôs break it down:</p>
        <h3>1. Vedas and Upanishads</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>These oldest texts don‚Äôt mention blasphemy as a crime.</li>
            <li>Questioning, doubting, or even denying gods is part of the philosophical tradition. For example, the Nasadiya Sukta (Rigveda 10.129) openly questions the existence and knowledge of the gods themselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>üëâ So skepticism was not seen as punishable; rather, inquiry was encouraged.</p>

        <h3>2. Epics & Puranas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Many characters openly insult or mock gods (like Ravana mocking Rama, Shishupala mocking Krishna).</li>
            <li>The gods respond in the narrative, but there is no religious law saying society must punish blasphemers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>üëâ This shows Hindu tradition tolerates even sharp criticism of religion.</p>

        <h3>3. Dharmashastra (like Manusmriti)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>These texts give social/religious rules, but not really laws on blasphemy in the Abrahamic sense.</li>
            <li>Speaking ill of gods is seen as adharma (sin), but punishment is mostly karmic (fate after death), not state-legal punishment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Bhakti & Sant tradition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medieval Bhakti saints (like Kabir, Ravidas, Mirabai) often criticized rituals, priests, and even gods in strong language.</li>
            <li>Instead of being executed as blasphemers, they were revered by many and started reform movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>üëâ This shows Hindu tradition tolerates even sharp criticism of religion.</p>

        <h3>5. Today</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hindu-majority India historically never had blasphemy laws.</li>
            <li>Modern Indian law (Section 295A IPC), which punishes ‚Äúinsult to religion,‚Äù was introduced by the British in 1927, not by Hindu scripture.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="summary">
            <h3>‚ú® Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hinduism does not have a concept of blasphemy as a crime.</li>
                <li>Criticizing gods or scriptures is seen as disrespectful or sinful but not punishable by law in the tradition.</li>
                <li>The idea of blasphemy laws came to India via colonial rule, not from Vedas, Puranas, or Bhakti teachings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Blasphemy in Guru Granth Sahib</h2>
    
        <h3>1. No concept of ‚Äúblasphemy law‚Äù</h3>
        <p>The Guru Granth Sahib does not prescribe any worldly punishment for people who insult God, Gurus, or the scripture. Instead, it emphasizes that disrespect only harms the one who shows it, because God cannot be diminished.</p>
    
        <h3>2. What it actually says</h3>
        <p>Mocking God or the Guru is seen as ignorance (<em>ahamkar</em>, <em>haumai</em>), not as a crime. Example ideas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A person who insults the Guru or God is simply lost in ego; their soul suffers separation from divine truth.</li>
            <li>God is beyond harm ‚Äî human words can‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù the Infinite.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>3. Sikh Gurus‚Äô approach in history</h3>
        <p>The Sikh Gurus themselves faced ridicule and persecution (e.g., Guru Nanak was mocked for rejecting rituals, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur were executed by Mughal rulers for their stance). Their response was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patience, forgiveness, and courage, not revenge.</li>
            <li>Sikh history shows the idea of standing firm in faith, not punishing others for disbelief or insult.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>4. Focus on inner discipline</h3>
        <p>The scripture teaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Criticism and insults from others should be met with humility (<em>sehaj</em>, <em>shanti</em>).</li>
            <li>The real ‚Äúblasphemy‚Äù in Sikh thought is forgetting God, living in ego, or exploiting others, not insulting words.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>5. Today</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sikhism doesn‚Äôt have religious blasphemy laws.</li>
            <li>However, socially, many Sikhs consider desecration of Guru Granth Sahib (like burning or tearing it) deeply offensive, since the scripture is revered as the living Guru.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h3>‚ú® Summary (Sikh view):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guru Granth Sahib: Insults do not harm God, only the insulter.</li>
                <li>No punishment system, only karmic consequences.</li>
                <li>True disrespect is forgetting God, not mere words.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Subtopic: Shabads (hymns) in Guru Granth Sahib -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Shabads (hymns) in Guru Granth Sahib</h3>
            <p>Sometimes when people read Shabads (hymns) in Guru Granth Sahib or other Sikh texts in translation, the language can sound very strong, even violent ‚Äî words like ‚Äúbehead,‚Äù ‚Äúcut,‚Äù ‚Äúburn,‚Äù etc. Let‚Äôs clear that up:</p>
    
            <h4>1. Metaphorical / Poetic Language</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sikh scripture uses intense metaphors to shake the ego and inspire deep devotion.</li>
                <li>For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚ÄúOffer your head to the Guru‚Äù ‚Üí means surrender your ego, pride, and self-centeredness, not literal beheading.</li>
                        <li>‚ÄúCut off your head and place it before Him‚Äù ‚Üí means total dedication and readiness to sacrifice for Truth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>2. Historical context of Sikhs and sacrifice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Later Sikh history (esp. Guru Arjan, Guru Tegh Bahadur, Guru Gobind Singh) involved real martyrdom, where Sikhs literally gave their heads rather than abandon truth.</li>
                <li>So the poetry of ‚Äúbeheading‚Äù also carried a martial spirit ‚Äî willingness to die for righteousness (<em>dharam</em>).</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>3. Examples of Shabad imagery</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>‚ÄúSir dhar tali gali meri aao, taan sachche sahib seho mil paao.‚Äù</strong><br>
                    ‚Üí ‚ÄúCome to the path with your head in the palm of your hand, only then can you meet the True Lord.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚úÖ This is figurative: complete surrender.
                </li>
                <li>Not: ‚ÄúKill people if they don‚Äôt follow God.‚Äù</li>
                <li>Instead: ‚ÄúBe ready to sacrifice your own head (ego, comfort, even life) for God.‚Äù</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>4. No call for violence against others</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Guru Granth Sahib never says ‚Äúbehead someone else‚Äù for not believing.</li>
                <li>The only ‚Äúbeheading‚Äù imagery is self-offering (your ego, or your life in God‚Äôs path).</li>
            </ul>
    
            <div class="summary">
                <h4>‚ú® So in short:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Shabads you remember with ‚Äúbeheading‚Äù are metaphorical and devotional, not laws for punishing blasphemy.</li>
                    <li>They‚Äôre about your own sacrifice for Truth, not hurting others.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    
            <h4>Example Shabads</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guru Nanak (Sri Raag, Ang 83)</strong><br>
                    ‚ÄúSir dhar tali gali meri aao. Taan sachche sahib seho mil paao.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúCome to my path with your head placed on the palm of your hand. Only then will you meet the True Lord.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚úÖ Meaning: The devotee must be ready to surrender ego, pride, even life, for God.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bhai Gurdas Ji (not in Guru Granth Sahib, but foundational Sikh writings)</strong><br>
                    ‚ÄúSir jaave ta jaave, mera Sikhi sidak na jaave.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúLet my head be taken away, but may my faith in Sikhi never leave me.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚úÖ Meaning: True faith is worth more than life itself.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Guru Arjan Dev Ji (Ang 370)</strong><br>
                    ‚ÄúSir deeaa par sirar na deeaa.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúI gave my head, but not my honor (faith).‚Äù<br>
                    ‚úÖ Meaning: Even under torture, Guru Arjan sacrificed his life but never betrayed Truth.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Guru Gobind Singh Ji (Dasam Granth, not Guru Granth Sahib but often quoted)</strong><br>
                    ‚ÄúSir deeaa par chhadee na Sikhi.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúI gave my head, but I did not abandon Sikhi.‚Äù<br>
                    ‚úÖ Again about personal sacrifice, not harming others.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Guru Angad Dev Ji (MehlƒÅ 2) - Ang 89</strong><br>

                    <p>At first sight, it sounds like a call for beheading. But Gurbani is always poetic and metaphorical here:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Meaning of ‚Äúhead‚Äù (sir):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The head represents ego, pride, stubbornness (<em>haumai</em>).</li>
                                <li>A head that does not bow = a person who refuses humility before God, lives in arrogance.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Meaning of ‚Äúcutting off the head‚Äù:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It does not mean physical beheading of anyone.</li>

        <h2>Blasphemy in Bible</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Old Testament / Hebrew Bible</h3>
        <p>The most direct references to blasphemy as a punishable offense are found in Leviticus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leviticus 24:16</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúAnyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death. The whole assembly shall stone them.‚Äù<br>
                ‚û°Ô∏è Here, blasphemy is speaking irreverently against God. The punishment prescribed is death by stoning.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Leviticus 5:1</strong> ‚Äì Discusses sins against God and blasphemous speech requiring atonement, showing blasphemy is considered both a spiritual and legal offense.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>2. New Testament</h3>
        <p>The New Testament focuses more on forgiveness, mercy, and internal morality. However, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is mentioned as ‚Äúunforgivable‚Äù:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mark 3:29</strong> ‚Äì ‚ÄúBut whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven.‚Äù<br>
                ‚û°Ô∏è Here, it is a spiritual consequence, not a legal punishment.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>‚ú® Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Old Testament:</strong> Blasphemy could be punished by death (Leviticus).</li>
                <li><strong>New Testament:</strong> Blasphemy is mostly a spiritual sin; no worldly punishment is prescribed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Summary of Religions</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Religions that do not prescribe worldly punishment for blasphemy in scripture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hinduism:</strong> Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas ‚Äì No law punishing criticism or insult to gods; disrespect is a sin or bad karma, not a crime.</li>
            <li><strong>Sikhism (Guru Granth Sahib):</strong> Mocking God or scripture is spiritually wrong, but the ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù is personal or karmic; no legal or violent action is prescribed.</li>
            <li><strong>Some Buddhist traditions:</strong> Insulting the Buddha or monks is ethically wrong, but there‚Äôs no divine or legal punishment mandated in scripture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>‚úÖ These religions focus on inner consequences, spiritual discipline, and moral conduct, not executing or imprisoning someone for blasphemy.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Religions that include punishable blasphemy in religious law (not always in scripture)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Islam:</strong> Qur‚Äôan itself ‚Äì no earthly punishment; Hadith and later Islamic law introduced death/penalties for insulting God/Prophet.</li>
            <li><strong>Christianity:</strong> Early medieval canon law treated blasphemy as a crime; modern secular states largely removed it.</li>
            <li><strong>Judaism:</strong> Torah prescribes severe punishment (death) for certain blasphemy in the Hebrew Bible, though in practice ancient Jewish courts rarely executed it.</li>
